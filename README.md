# hello_world
my first project on github!
uhh... hi I'm Daniela.
I have no idea what I am doing right now other than following the instructions for https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ 
It's currently 10:29 PM and I wanna go to bed but I want to finish this and another mini project before going to bed... only one of those things is getting done if I'm being honest. But I can also start it :)
